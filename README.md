# js_katas
A series of katas resolved in JavaScript using TDD with mocha

For running all the tests you should have installed node.js v0.8 or higher(https://nodejs.org/en/download/) in other to use
npm to install dev dependencies such as Mocha for testing and gulp to automate tasks.

So, run in your command line `npm install` to install all dependencies.

And to run the tests, just run `gulp mocha-test` in your command line, and for development, run `gulp` to watch all changes
and run tests after any changes automatically.

Have fun! :)
